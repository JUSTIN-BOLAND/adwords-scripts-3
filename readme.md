# Google Scripts
Some simple automations. A work in progress. Check out the [Google docs](https://developers.google.com/adwords/scripts/docs/your-first-script) for more info.

### cost_stats.js
A script that calculates how much you've spent on a Google AdWords campaign through the present day and enters that total into an existing Google spreadsheet along with the date updated.

#### Getting Started
You'll want to have a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/) created before you use this.

1. Log into your AdWords account.
2. Navigate to a campaign.
3. Select `bulk operations` >  `scripts`.
4. Create a new script.
5. Paste `cost_stats.js` into it.
6. Replace the fields indicated in the script with your own information. Be careful not to remove the script's quotation marks.
